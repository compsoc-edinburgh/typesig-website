# TypeSig Website
This is the website for TypeSig.
It's hosted using GitHub Pages, and the domain is managed by CompSoc (currently).

## Adding Posts
Add a new post by putting a markdown file in the `_posts/` directory.
It's easier to copy an existing file and modify it as a template.
If you're adding an image (which is recommended cos it looks sick on the main page), please ensure that it is cropped to a 16:10 aspect ratio, as otherwise it will offset your post compared to the others.

## Building
The site will automatically rebuild whenever you push to this branch. It takes around 2 minutes to update.

You can also build locally (useful when changing the site substantially) using `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
