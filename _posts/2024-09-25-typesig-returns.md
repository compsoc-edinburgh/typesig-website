TypeSig is officially one year old!
We're celebrating with a brand new URL, an updated logo, and some exciting new events!

We're returning in full swing this academic year with some new faces, as well as some familiar ones!
The Lean 4 workshops, co-hosted by us and MathsSoc, are continuing this year on Mondays from 5pm-7pm. Alex Brodbelt is kindly giving a talk at the beginning of each workshop, so definitely come along to develop your Lean skills!

We're also proud to announce a brand new, all-TypeSig workshop on making your own programming language interpreter! This is fully self paced, and the materials can be found on [our new resources page][mal-resources]. We're running workshop sessions every Friday from 4pm-6pm, where you can get further advice and assistance if you need it.

Of course, our pub socials on Sundays at the Dagda bar continue as per usual. See you there each week from 7pm!

We have some more exciting events in the works, so keep tuned to the announcements channel on [our Discord server][discord], as per usual.

TypeSig <3 you!
