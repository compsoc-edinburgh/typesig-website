Yesterday was the Annual Lecture for Mathematics Students, which we co-hosted wih the School of Mathematics. The guest lecturer was [Kevin Buzzard][kevin], who gave a talk on how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT might be integrated with theorem provers. As you can see from the image above, we completely filled AT Lecture Theatre 2! That's over 200 people!

A massive thanks to everyone who came, and special thanks to the School of Maths for organising the talk, and to Kevin Buzzard, who gave a second talk on his [Natural Number Game][nng], which we've been following in our Lean workshops for the past month.
