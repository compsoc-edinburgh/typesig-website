TUPLE (Types Union Programming Languages, Edinburgh) is a new student conference organised by TypeSig.
The goal of the conference is to introduce more undergraduate students to research in programming language theory and theoretical computer science.

The conference is scheduled to take place on the 21st February, 2024 at the Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton Street, Edinburgh, EH8 9AB.

## Topics
Covering topics include, but are not limited to: 
- Programming languages 
- Functional programming
- Compilers
- Interactive theorem proving
- Formal verification
- Type theory 
- Concurrency

## Expected Audience
TUPLE is the culmination of sustained student interest in PL research over the past few years.
We aim to expose more undergraduate and graduate students to PL through a day of academic talks delivered by researchers in the field.
The intended audience is primarily undergraduate students with some prior exposure to PL through functional programming, although anyone is welcome to attend.

Based on the successful precedent of [PwnEd 2023][pwned] (a cybersecurity conference run by another [CompSoc][compsoc] SIG) as well as TypeSigâ€™s previous events this year, we expect TUPLE to attract significant attention from the student body in and outwith the the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.
