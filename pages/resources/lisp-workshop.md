Welcome to the lisp workshop! This is a series of worksheets that will walk you through implementing an interpreter for a programming language. The steps are designed to be completed in order; if you're stuck on one of the steps, ask a TypeSig committee member for help in the workshop, or post a message on our [Discord server][discord].

You can choose which language to write the interpreter in; pick one that you're comfortable with already, or if you want a further challenge, pick one that you want to learn!
